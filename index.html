    <h2>Hi, I'm Kristin Schallhorn</h2>
    <p>After graduating from the University of Maryland with a degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice, I realized that I had a passion for front-end web development and wanted to pursue that career path â€“ not the one that I had just earned a degree for.</p>
    <p>Rather than going straight back to school to earn a new degree, I decided to use other resources available to me to learn the necessary skills to become employable in that field.</p>
    <p>I have worked my way into my current position at Oracle as a self-taught Technical Support Engineer. I am now interested in gaining some professional education to supplement the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge that I have gained along the way.</p>
    <p>I have enrolled in this course to become a more professional, knowledgable, and technically accurate coder.</p>
    <p>All that being said, the most important piece of information about me is that I have a Shiba Inu pup who will forever be cooler than me in every way.</p>
